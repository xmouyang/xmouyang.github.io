I am an Assistant Professor at Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) since Fall 2024. I lead the [HKUST Mobile, Intelligent, and Networked System (MINSys) Group](https://xmouyang.github.io/Team/). Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at UCLA Networked & Embedded Systems Lab, working with [Prof. Mani Srivastava](https://www.ee.ucla.edu/mani-srivastava/) (ACM/IEEE Fellow). I obtained my Ph.D. degree from The Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2023, advised by [Prof. Guoliang Xing](https://staff.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/~glxing/) (ACM/IEEE Fellow), and co-advised by [Prof. Jianwei Huang](https://jianwei.cuhk.edu.cn/) (IEEE Fellow). I received [ACM MobiSys Best Paper Award](https://xmouyang.github.io/assets/pdf/MobiSys_best_paper.pdf) and [ACM SIGBED China Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award](https://xmouyang.github.io/assets/pdf/SIGBED_China_best_dissertation.pdf). I was named one of [EECS Rising Stars](https://eecsrisingstars2023.cc.gatech.edu/participants/) in 2023 and [mHealth Scholars](https://mhti.md2k.org/index.php/scholars/2024-scholars) in 2024.


<!-- I also worked closely with [Prof. Jiayu Zhou](https://jiayuzhou.github.io/) in my PhD.-->

My current research interest is **empowering mobile and IoT devices with AI** to create **ambient intelligence** for **smart health** applications.

- **Embedded AI**: address real-world data and system challenges for advancing ML in mobile/IoT systems.
- **Smart Health**: design and deploy real-world IoT systems for personalized health monitoring and intervention, e.g., [monitoring digital biomarkers of Alzheimerâ€™s Disease](https://cuhk-alzheimers-ai.github.io/).
- **Mobile Sensing**: enhance sensing quality with physics-strengthened AI techniques.

<!-- 
**Key words of my recent research topics:** Multi-Modal Sensing and Learning, Federated Learning Systems, Large Language Models, Activity Recognition, Digital Biomarkers, ToF Depth Sensing Systems.
-->

I am always actively looking for highly motivated students to join my group (**Earliest round for Ph.D.: 2025 Fall**) and **one postdoc** with competitive salaries.. I also have several research internship positions opening starting anytime. See [openings](https://xmouyang.github.io/opening/) for more details. Please <a href="mailto:xmouyang@cse.ust.hk">email me</a> your CV and transcript if you are interested in.
