**Course Description**: This course will introduce the techniques on deploying AI models on ubiquitous yet resource-constrained platforms such as embedded, mobile, and edge devices. Students will develop a deep understanding of embedded and on-device AI systems, gain hands-on experience in implementation, and learn the practical challenges of applying AI in real-world scenarios.

The major topics include 1) Fundamentals of machine learning and embedded systems; 2) Data and system challenges in embedded AI; 3) AI techniques and their efficient deployment on cutting-edge platforms; 4)Real-world applications, such as mobile agent and smart health. The course structure will primarily consist of instructor lectures, paper presentations and hands-on projects/labs.

By the end of the course, students will be equipped to deploy AI models, including large language models (LLMs), on embedded, mobile and edge devices for applications such as mobile agents, smart health, and more.

**Course Objectives**: After completion of this course, the students will have in-depth understanding of challenges in embedded AI systems, hands-on experience in implementing state-of-the-art embedded AI algorithms in real-world systems or applications, and critical thinking ability to tackle embedded AI problems.

**Pre-requisite**: (COMP 2012 OR COMP 2012H) AND COMP 2211. Basic understanding of machine learning is required. Familiarity or experience with the fundamentals of embedded or mobile systems are preferred.
