**Course Description**: This course will enable students to have an in-depth understanding of embedded AI algorithms and their implementation in real systems and applications. The major topics include 1) basics on machine learning; 2) data and system challenges in embedded AI 3) AI techniques and their implementation on cutting-edge platforms 4) real-world applications, such as smart health and smart buildings. The course structure will primarily consist of instructor presentations, student presentations, paper summaries, and a course project. Students will work on an individual or team project to build an end-to-end embedded AI system. Students will also read and discuss the latest publications in the areas of embedded AI, Internet of Things, mobile systems, and ubiquitous computing.

**Course Objectives**: After completion of this course, the students will have in-depth understanding of challenges in embedded AI systems, hands-on experience in implementing state-of-the-art embedded AI algorithms in real-world systems or applications, and critical thinking ability to tackle embedded AI problems.

**Pre-requisite**: Basic understanding of machine learning is required. Familiarity or experience with the fundamentals of embedded or mobile systems are preferred.
